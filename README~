============================================================================================================

The Aim of the Gisedu project is to provide a platform to visualize geospatial intelligence data pertinent to
eTech Ohio initiatives including technology based instruction, broad-band adoption, conference attendance and
much much more.

Project Gisedu pronounced (GIS-ed-you) is still in the early phases of incubation and is not officially supported
by eTech Ohio Commission or the State of Ohio.

Project Gisedu is made up of several tiers of services that each work off of each other to achieve a desktop calibre
GIS application that runs inside any modern web browser. These tiers are:

The Administration Tier
    - Quantum GIS pushing to Postgresql 8 PostGIS database.

The Database Teir
    - Postgresql 8 with PostGIS (Geometry is Stored as EPSG:4326 Standard WGS84)
    
The Spatial Query Teir (ORM)
    - Python 2.6/2.7 & Django 2.5 with GeoDjango
    
The Web Client Teir
    - Cappuchino version 0.9 & Objective-J (https://github.com/280north/cappuccino)
        - Also using OJTest for unit testing (https://github.com/280north/OJTest)
    
    - MapKit Fork by jfahrenkrug (https://github.com/jfahrenkrug/MapKit) (Google Maps V2)
        - jfahrenkrug - We will again be forking this as a seperate project shortly. Its time to use V3 ;)
