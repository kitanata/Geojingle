Janurary 23rd 2012
==================
- Fixed issue where display options were not cleared on overlays when a new
project was loaded.
- Fixed issue where under certain circumstances the FilterOutline displayed
items more than once.
- Removed all the 'loader' code and replaced all usages with JsonRequest for
JSON POST and GETs and HtmlRequest for HTML GETs. Name is dependant on type of
data recieved.
- Removed DictionaryLoader. Replaced usage with JsonRequest
- Removed a bunch of the old 'Loader' code. Reducing request sized for new
overlays and adding a small speed improvement. Cleaner, Faster code.
- Fixed issue with some items being removed from the map when they shouldnt
be. 
- Fixed an issue where display options were not applied to overlays correctly
when loading new data. 
- Removed old dead code responsible for loading individual overlays.
- Fixed error where display options where overridden on overlays during
loading.
- Updated C-Tags
- Added MPL license headers to a bunch of files... some code that we forked we
are keeping with their original licenses out of respect to the community. It
would be a nasty thing to take MIT license stuff and relicense it under
MPL(even though MIT License says we can).
- Added new Cappucinno 0.95 packages to Frameworks directory
- Added loading screen from UpdateMap event.
- Optimized the hell out of the map refreshes client-side
